# Backbone.ioBind

Backbone.ioBind allows you to bind socket.io events to backbone model & collection events.
Also includes `backbone.iosync.js`, a drop in replacement for `Backbone.sync` that uses socket.io.

Your best best for starting is to check out the [API Documentation](http://alogicalparadox.com/backbone.iobind/).

* [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/backboneiobind)
* [Changelog](https://github.com/logicalparadox/backbone.iobind/blob/master/History.md)

#### Dependancies

* [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) 0.7.x || 0.8.x || 0.9.x
* [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) 1.0.0

#### Compatibility

Use Backbone.ioBind < 0.4.6 for compatibility with version Backbone less then 1.0.0

### Usage

Download and include in your projects.

```html
<script src="/js/backbone.iosync.js"></script>
<script src="/js/backbone.iobind.js"></script>
```

Or use the minimized versions.

```html
<script src="/js/backbone.iosync.min.js"></script>

## Using the Backbone.sync Replacement for Socket.io

The Backbone.sync replacement, `backbone.iosync.js`, is a drop-in replacement for Backbone.sync that
will make Backbone use socket.io for all normal CRUD operations. By this, anytime you `save` a model,
`fetch` a collection, `remove` a model, or other database operation, socket.io will be used as the
transport.

### Namespaces / Urls

Backbone has a dedicated attribute, `urlRoot` for models, and `url` for collections, that is used
by the default sync method to direct AJAX request. ioSync uses this same attribute to create a
namespace tag for that model.

*For Example:* If your collection url is 'posts' or '/posts', the events to listen for server-side will be:

* `posts:create`
* `posts:read`
* `posts:update`
* `posts:delete`

As with the default sync method, for a given model, ioSync will default to the `url` of the collection
that model is a part of, else it will use the models `urlRoot`.

If your url has a depth of more than one, only the first will be used. Example: `/posts/comments` will still only have a namespace of `posts`.*

### RPC / Callbacks

This replacement assumes that you are using socket.io's RPC (callback) formula for these events.
Examine this psuedo-code:

```js
socket.on('posts:read', function (data, callback) {
  db.query({_id: data.id}, function (err, model) {
    if (err) {
      callback(err);
    } else {
      // ... some data scrubbing
      callback(null, model);
    }
  });
});
```

The callback accepts two parameters: `error` and `model`. If no error has occurred, send `null` for `error`.

The `model` should be a JSON representation of the client-side model's attributes.

## Using Backbone.ioBind for Custom Events

The primary function for Backbone.ioBind is to make it easy to create client-side listeners
for server-side socket.io events. The most likely use case for this is to broadcast changes
made by one client to all other clients watching a particular data object.

The example app demonstrates a very basic usage scenario. If you would like to see specific code
examples, please check out the
[wiki page on using the example app](http://alogicalparadox.com/backbone.iobind/index.html#exampleapp).

### ioBind

The ioBind function is available for both Models and Collections, and behaves almost identically in both scenarios

```js
// Example Model.extend
urlRoot: 'todo',
initialize: function () {
  _.bindAll(this, 'serverChange', 'serverDelete', 'modelCleanup');
  this.ioBind('update', window.socket, this.serverChange, this);
  this.ioBind('delete', window.socket, this.serverDelete, this);
}

// Example Collection.exend
url: 'todos',
initialize: function () {
  _.bindAll(this, 'serverCreate', 'collectionCleanup');
  this.ioBind('create', window.socket, this.serverCreate, this);
}
```

The primary difference between `ioBind` on Models and Collection is the event string that is listened for.
On models, the event string includes the Model `id`, whereas on collection it is simply the collection namespace.

The above example will respond to the following socket.io events.

```js
// Model events
socket.emit('todo/' + todo_obj.id + ':update', todo_obj);
socket.emit('todo/' + todo_obj.id + ':delete', todo_obj);

// Collection events
socket.emit('todos:create', todo_obj);
```

### Usage Guidelines

*Model binding without ID:* Do NOT bind to Models that do NOT have an `id` assigned. This will cause for extra listeners
and cause potentially large memory leak problems. See the example app for one possible workaround.

*Namespace construction:* When constructing the namespace, as with the the ioSync method, for a given model ioBind
will default to the `url` of the collectionthat model is a part of, else it will use the models `urlRoot`.

*Reserved events:* Do NOT bind to reserved backbone events, such as `change`, `remove`, and `add`. Proxy these
events using different event tags such as `update`, `delete`, and `create`.

## Building

Clone this repo:

`$ git clone https://github.com/logicalparadox/backbone.iobind`

Install development/build dependancies (Ie: [folio](https://github.com/logicalparadox/folio)).:

`$ npm install`

Run make

`$ make`

#### Example Tasks Application

There is an example application demonstrating the basics of using the
`ioSync` and `ioBind` components. It is a tasks application that will keep itself syncronized across all open
browser instances. The foundation is an [Express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express)
server using [Seed](https://github.com/logicalparadox/seed) as an in-memory data store.

The app is found in the `example` folder.
View the [Documentation Article](http://alogicalparadox.com/backbone.iobind/index.html#exampleapp)
on the example app for instructions on how to get everything set up.

In short, run `node example/app.js` from the root directory.
